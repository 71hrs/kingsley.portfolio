        <h2>Yuhui Qi</h2>
        <p>
          Yuhui (Kingsley) Qi is a designer and researcher exploring the intersections of design, technology, and human experience. With a background in Chemical Engineering from Zhejiang University of Technology and an MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design, he bridges scientific thinking with artistic inquiry. His practice spans interactive installations, speculative design, and digital platforms, with a focus on creating experimental systems that question how humans connect with each other and with emerging technologies.
          <br><br>
          His current interests center on the role of AI, brain–computer interfaces, and immersive environments in shaping new modes of perception and interaction. He sees design not only as a tool for solving problems but also as a method of probing future scenarios and alternative realities. By combining technical knowledge with critical speculation, Yuhui aims to contribute to the Media Lab’s culture of interdisciplinary research and its mission to prototype new possibilities for human–machine collaboration and cultural expression.
