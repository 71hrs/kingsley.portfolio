            In a future where oceans cover ninety-five percent of the planet, humanity is forced to reinvent itself, adapting to life beneath the sea. A new civilization thrives in the deep, where humans no longer stand apart from nature but live in continuous exchange with it. Here, organisms and humans intertwine in symbiotic relationships that blur the distinction between species. These marine beings function like external “organs,” merging with the human body to extend its capabilities while drawing nourishment and protection in return. This underwater world is not a tale of domination, but of reciprocity — a vision of life redefined through balance, equality, and coexistence.

          <p class="project-paragraph" style="color: white;">
            Organisms Utopia is a speculative design project — a hypothetical vision rather than a scientific prototype. It does not aim to predict technology, but to use design fiction to provoke reflection. By imagining a world where survival depends on symbiosis instead of control, the project invites us to reconsider humanity’s relationship with other life forms. Returning to the ocean — the cradle of all life — this work asks a simple yet profound question: what might it mean not only to be human, but to be alive, if equality across species became our foundation?

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Organisms Utopia unfolds as a speculative design project that uses wearable art as a medium to explore new paradigms of symbiosis. Instead of aiming for scientific accuracy, the project constructs a fictional ecology where organisms and humans evolve together beneath the ocean, prompting reflection on how such coexistence could reshape our definitions of life and interdependence.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Within this imagined world, marine organisms emerge from diverse habitats — coral reefs, deep trenches, kelp forests, and open waters. Each carries distinctive traits that grant oceanic humans new sensory or functional abilities, while drawing nourishment and shelter from the human body in return. These relationships are not simply parasitic or utilitarian; they represent an alternate vision of reciprocity and equality across species.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            To materialize this vision, the project employs experimental making methods such as 3D printing, heat-shrinkable materials, and UV resin. The resulting wearable artifacts — designed for the head, shoulders, arms, and hands — act as proxies for speculative organisms. Some integrate sensors to simulate touch or environmental response, inviting the audience to imagine how it might feel to host or embody another life form. Through these crafted experiences, Organisms Utopia seeks to provoke dialogue about our future entanglement with the living world.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            The project positions itself within the field of speculative design, where fiction is used as a tool to question present realities and imagine alternative futures. Organisms Utopia does not aim to model scientific truth; instead, it borrows inspiration from marine biology, parasitic systems, and ecological principles to create a sense of plausibility. This approach, often referred to as “fictional prototyping,” allows design to operate as a form of inquiry: not to predict what will happen, but to ask what if and to explore the cultural and ethical implications of such possibilities.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            By weaving together fragments of science, design, and narrative, the methodology emphasizes the role of design as a catalyst for reflection. In this way, the project situates itself not as a forecast of technological progress, but as a platform for dialogue about how humanity might reimagine its relationship with other life forms.

In this stage, the mutualistic logic of the project was established.

            In parallel, collaboration with biologists and environmental scientists informed the speculative organisms. Conversations about marine ecology, parasitism, and biodiversity shaped the plausibility of their forms. At the same time, theoretical dialogue—drawing from biosemiotics and cellular signaling pathways—framed the organisms as agents of symbolic communication. Insights from ecological philosophy and posthumanist thought further shifted the perspective beyond anthropocentrism, situating humans, nonhumans, and environments within a shared network of interdependence. These exchanges grounded the work in both scientific reference and philosophical reflection, allowing design, ecology, and imagination to converge.
