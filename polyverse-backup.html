            Polyverse is a mobile product that redefines how Gen Z users explore cities in their fragmented time. By combining a real-time hotspot map with a task-based system, Polyverse helps users quickly discover trending places, plan spontaneous activities, and collect achievements through exploration. The project was designed and developed from research to high-fidelity prototyping, focusing on lowering the barrier to participation while creating a playful and engaging urban experience.

            Polyverse was initiated from the observation that Gen Z users often face idle moments in the city without a clear plan. These fragmented periods present an opportunity for spontaneous exploration, yet existing tools rarely support this behavior. The goal of the project is to design a product that transforms such moments into meaningful experiences by lowering the barrier to participation and encouraging playful, real-time discovery.

            Market Research

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Many fragmented-time scenarios in daily urban life resemble behaviors seen in travel — moments of waiting, sudden schedule changes, or the need for quick inspiration. To better understand these patterns, I started by analyzing the travel app ecosystem, which highlights how most products emphasize planning and booking while overlooking real-time, lightweight exploration.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            I mapped the travel app ecosystem into three phases: before, during, and after the trip. Most platforms—such as Pinterest, Klook, or Tripadvisor—concentrate on inspiration, planning, and sharing. Very few provide support for spontaneous decisions during the trip, which mirrors the gap in fragmented-time exploration for urban life.

            After mapping the ecosystem, I conducted a competitive analysis of eight representative platforms. I compared them across dimensions such as core offering, target users, map integration, AI utilization, personalization, and gamification. The findings show that most platforms focus heavily on booking, reviews, or planning. Very few place maps at the center of interaction, and almost none combine real-time hotspot discovery with gamified task systems — leaving a clear gap that defines Polyverse’s opportunity.

            To uncover how Gen Z users manage fragmented time and what drives their exploration behavior, I conducted user research combining surveys and interviews. This helped me capture both broad behavioral patterns and deeper personal motivations, forming the foundation for Polyverse.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            The survey revealed clear patterns: most users tend to spend short breaks on quick entertainment, but a significant number expressed interest in discovering nearby places or activities.

            The research revealed four key insights. First, both the market and users demand low-barrier and lightweight interactions, as fragmented-time exploration cannot rely on complex planning. Second, there is a clear need for real-time hotspot discovery, especially during short breaks or idle moments. Third, social influence plays a critical role, as users are more motivated to explore when recommendations come from friends or communities. Finally, recognition and achievement systems are essential to sustain engagement, yet they remain largely unsupported in existing solutions.

            Building on the design system, I translated the core user flows into high-fidelity UI screens. These key interfaces showcase how the product comes together—balancing functionality with a clean, engaging visual style tailored for quick, everyday use.

            To evaluate the effectiveness of the high-fidelity design and uncover potential usability issues, I conducted usability testing with Gen Z participants. The goal was to observe how easily users could navigate key tasks — such as discovering hotspots, adding activities, and tracking progress — and to identify opportunities for refinement.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            This project was not only about building a functional product but also about refining my design thinking process. From the early low-fidelity iterations, I learned how simple changes—such as introducing a list mode or integrating mission flows directly into the map—could dramatically shift user efficiency and engagement. Through usability testing, I confronted real user pain points and translated feedback into actionable improvements, which guided the hi-fidelity iterations where interface clarity and interaction smoothness became my focus.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Ultimately, Polyverse taught me to balance exploration with structure: creating an experience that feels open and spontaneous, yet grounded in usability and clarity. As a product designer, this journey reinforced the importance of iterative testing, designing with both system logic and emotional resonance in mind, and being willing to reframe solutions when user behavior revealed new insights.
