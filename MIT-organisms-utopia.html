This underwater society represents a novel species, embracing a unique way of life. Here, all life forms are regarded as equals, fostering a symbiotic relationship that transcends traditional boundaries.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph" style="color: white;">
            Through centuries of evolution, certain organisms have developed a profound connection with the oceanic humans, acting as external "organs" that coexist and thrive alongside the human body, forming a harmonious symbiosis. This symbiosis is characterized by cellular communion, allowing these organisms to enhance the bodily functions of the oceanic humans, while benefiting from the human lifestyle in return.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph" style="color: white;">
            The mutualistic relationship extends beyond mere survival, enabling the organisms to aid in their own species' reproduction and continued existence. This era heralds a paradigm shift towards coexistence and mutual prosperity, paving the way for a harmonious future where the oceanic people and marine life coexist in a balanced and equitable manner, emphasizing equality and harmony among species.

            To validate the design opportunity, I conducted surveys and interviews with potential users across industrial safety and emergency response contexts. The findings highlighted several critical pain points in traditional gas mask use:
            <br>
          	•	Consumable monitoring (72%) – Users cannot accurately detect filter cartridge usage, leading to uncertainty about protection reliability.
            <br>
          	•	Environmental awareness (86%) – Existing masks provide no real-time feedback on external gas conditions, leaving wearers reactive rather than proactive.
            <br>
          	•	Communication and ergonomics (80%) – Heavy, bulky equipment reduces comfort and makes verbal communication difficult during high-stress operations.

            These insights confirmed that next-generation masks must function as adaptive systems—not only filtering toxins but also sensing, communicating, and supporting decision-making in real time.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            While Chem Guard addresses immediate physical risks, I began to explore how protection might extend into the cognitive layer. Current research in brain–computer interfaces suggests that neural signals can reveal early signs of cognitive overload and stress. Building on this foundation, I envisioned a future version of Chem Guard that not only detects environmental hazards but also senses a user’s cognitive state in real time.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            In this speculative extension, lightweight neural sensors embedded in the device could monitor attention and fatigue, offering subtle feedback before errors occur. The interface might adapt dynamically—simplifying instructions, reducing external distractions, or alerting peers—transforming Chem Guard into a system that safeguards both body and mind.

            This proposal does not claim technological readiness, but rather frames a direction: how design could bridge safety and cognition in the era of human–machine symbiosis. It is an exploration of responsibility—what it means to create tools that anticipate not only external threats but also the limits of human resilience.

            This project challenged me to balance between immediate usability and long-term speculation. Through designing Chem Guard, I realized that protective technology cannot be reduced to a single layer of function—it must integrate physical safety, cognitive awareness, and social responsibility. The process also taught me the importance of working across disciplines: combining design, human factors, and emerging technologies shaped not only the product but also my way of thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            At the same time, I became aware of the limitations. While the current system provides tangible safeguards, it remains constrained by today’s sensing and processing capabilities. Speculative extensions into cognitive resilience highlight a direction, but require more robust validation from neuroscience and engineering.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Ultimately, the most valuable lesson was that design is not just about solutions, but about framing questions that extend into the future. This reflection has deepened my interest in exploring how brain–computer interfaces and adaptive systems can expand the scope of protection—from the body to the mind—aligning with my pursuit of design at the intersection of technology and human experience.
