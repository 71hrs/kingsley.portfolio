            Originally designed to support the Huyou Beauty Contest, this project evolved into a broader exploration of how digital platforms can enhance talent competitions. While traditional competitions offer structured performances, they often lack real-time interaction, limiting audience engagement beyond passive viewing and simple voting.

            To address this, we propose a metaverse-inspired social media app that transforms talent competitions into an interactive experience.

To address this obstacle, I successfully collaborated with my undergraduate school's student union. They assisted in reaching out to contestants from their previous campus talent competitions for user testing, effectively overcoming this limitation.

            The iterative process was crucial in refining the design based on user feedback and testing, allowing for continuous improvements in both functionality and user experience. By focusing on real user needs, we were able to enhance the interface and ensure it was intuitive and engaging, ultimately shaping a more polished and user-friendly product.

            A key challenge was to keep users engaged with the app’s features without losing focus on the competition. To address this, a notification feature was added, sending timely reminders about key moments and voting opportunities to ensure users stay focused while interacting.

            In this project, a closer connection is fostered between contestants and audiences in talent competitions through the establishment of a mobile app platform, ultimately achieving the goal of promoting the competition. There are two key strategies to achieve this:
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Firstly, opportunities are provided for app users to earn points by completing tasks such as interacting with contestants. In return, these points can be redeemed for competition tickets and additional voting rights. This initiative aims to encourage audience participation, transforming them from passive spectators to active contributors.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Secondly, users can share links from the app to various social platforms, inviting others to join our project. As a reward, they are provided with point incentives as well. This strategy is aimed at expanding our user base, thus amplifying the reach of the competition.
